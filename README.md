# Undergraduate Research 2016-2017

Here I'll be uploading most of my work for my undergraduate research course.  
I'm working with Dr. Carlos Corrada on the topics of species identification and deep learning  

This repo will contain my work on the [Udacity Deep Learning Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)  
and code I wrote to tackle our research tasks.  

You can find more details in the appropriate READMEs, but all code is written with Python 3 and you can use pip3 to install:

**Research code dependencies**:
- pylab
- wave
- openpyxl
- pyyaml

**Course code requirements**:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- ipython
- scipy
- sklearn
- six
- jupyter
- tensorflow
- Pillow

If you want to install all dependencies just run:  
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
