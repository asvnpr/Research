# udacity_deep_learning_course
I'll be uploading/storing the code from quizzes and assignments here.

I'll be separating each section of the course in folders with the same name as the section.

## Assignments:

If you plan to run the code for the assignments, you can [install jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html) and follow along.
You'll probably have some missing dependencies. If so, you can run:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

at the root of this repo.

As of January 19, 2017, Jupyter notebook is displaying a kernel error on macOS 10.12 if python3.6 is your only python3.X version since it's looking for python3.5.
If you're in similar situation you can solve this by:
* Using a homebrew tap (such as [this one](https://github.com/zoidbergwill/homebrew-python))
* runnin `ln -s /usr/local/opt/python35/bin/python3.5 /usr/local/opt/python3/bin/python3.5` if you used the above homebrew tap

Now Jupyter should display no kernel errors.
