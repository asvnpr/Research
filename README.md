# Undergraduate Research 2016-2017

Here I'll be uploading most of my work for my undergraduate research course.  
I'm working with Dr. Carlos Corrada on the topics of species identification and deep learning  

This repo will contain my work on the [Udacity Deep Learning Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)  
and code I wrote to tackle our research tasks.  

You can find more thorough instructions in the included READMEs in the appropriate folders, but dependencies are:

* python3
* pylab / numpy+matplotlib
* jupyter notebook
* tensorflow
* ffmpeg (depends)
