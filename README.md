# Undergraduate Research 2016-2017, 2017-2018

Here I'll be uploading most of my work for my undergraduate research course.  
I'm working with Dr. Carlos Corrada on the topics of species identification and deep learning  

This repo will contain my work on the [Udacity Deep Learning Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)  
, the [Udacity Machine Learning Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120), and code I wrote to tackle our research tasks.

This semester (Fall 2017-2018), we'll be working to incorporate [Ian Flores](https://github.com/ian-flores/Deep-Learning-Species-Identification/)' convolutional neural network and data augmentation code.

You can find more details in the appropriate READMEs, but most of the code is written with Python 3 and you can use pip3 to install:

**Research code dependencies**:
- pylab
- wave
- openpyxl
- pyyaml

**Course code requirements**:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- ipython
- scipy
- sklearn
- six
- jupyter
- tensorflow
- Pillow

If you want to install all dependencies just run:  
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
