## notMINST assignment

For this section of the course, we'll be working with the notMINST dataset. You can follow the tensorflow notebook instructions [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynb).

I'm including the script for assignment1. You'll probably have some missing dependencies. If so, you can run:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

or just use pip if python 2.X is your default and you're using python 2.X for this course.

Afterwards you can run **assignment1.py** (I set it up to run python3 though so be aware of that.).
