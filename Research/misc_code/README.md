Here I include:

* flac__convert.sh: bash script to convert your dataset of recordings to wavs
* specgram_gen.ipynb: Python 3 Jupyter Notebook to generate spectrogram and functions to obtain ROI of a spectrogram

Requirement are:
* pylab (specgram_gen)
* ffmpeg (flac__convert)

Run:
`pip3 install pylab`

Run: 
`brew install ffmpeg`
or use your OS's package manager
