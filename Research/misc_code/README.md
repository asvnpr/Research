Here I include:

* flac__convert.sh: bash script to convert your dataset of recordings to wavs
* specgram_gen.ipynb: Python 3 Jupyter Notebook to generate spectrogram and functions to obtain ROI of a spectrogram

Requirement are:
* numpy
* matplotlib
* ffmpeg (convert_to_wav)

Run: 
`brew install ffmpeg`
or use your OS's package manager
