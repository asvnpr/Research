## notMINST assignment

For this section of the course, we'll be working with the notMINST dataset. You can follow the tensorflow notebook instructions [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynb).

I'm including the resolved problems for assignment1.
